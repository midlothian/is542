                <p>I'm a web developer &amp; infrastructure manager with a passion for clean interface design and a focus on streamlined technology experiences. I enjoy all aspects of the web, from server management to building Javascript functions to designing sleek interfaces. I believe that the more seamless a user's experience is, the more likely they are to return.</p>                
                <p>I speak designer, developer, architect, administrator, and user. Understanding the technology from every angle aids in creating an enriching experience that leverages the very best components the industry has to offer. </p>                
                <p>One day the world will be full of technology that always works the way the users expect it to and delivers value the way the company needs it to. Until then, it's my goal to work towards that ideal by designing and developing better technology solutions for everyone.</p>
